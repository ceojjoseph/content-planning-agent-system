# content-planning-agent-system
Offline AI-style agent system for content planning with workflow orchestration, memory, logging, and reporting.

## What it does
- Accepts a content goal, audience, tone, and CTA
- Executes a structured workflow (topics, posts, hashtags, schedule)
- Uses persistent memory to prevent duplicate execution
- Logs all actions with timestamps and status
- Produces a run report summarizing behavior

## Why it matters
The architecture mirrors real production agent systems, including:
- Tool routing
- Workflow orchestration
- Guardrails for ambiguity
- Persistent memory
- Audit logging and reporting

AI reasoning is simulated offline to focus on system design rather than API usage.
